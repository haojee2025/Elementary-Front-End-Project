## 📅 EFP-1-SimpleSolarSystem

Welcome to the first project in my Elementary Front-End Project series! 🚀 This project, Simple Solar System, is a beginner-friendly animation of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, where the Earth orbits the Sun and the Moon orbits the Earth, all built using HTML, and CSS (with a focus on CSS @keyframes for animations). No frameworks, no dependencies—just pure vanilla web development!

## 🧾 Project Overview

`This project creates a simple, animated representation of the solar system:`

- The Sun sits at the center of the scene.

- The Earth orbits the Sun in a circular path.

- The Moon orbits the Earth as it moves around the Sun.

- The animation is powered by CSS @keyframes, making it smooth and visually engaging.

- This is a great way to learn about CSS animations, positioning, and basic HTML structure <br>while exploring a fun, real-world concept! 🌍🌙☀️
