# Elementary-Front-End-Project<br>
Welcome! This is my personal learning repository for building beginner-friendly front-end projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks, no dependencies, just pure vanilla web development! 🚀 Starting on July 8, 2025, I’m committing to uploading at least one new project every week. This repository is a perfect resource for beginners learning web development or anyone seeking simple, practical coding examples.

## 🧾 What You’ll Find<br>

`📅 Daily Projects` 
- Each project is housed in a folder named EFP-X-ProjectName (e.g., EFP-1-ToDoList, EFP-2-Calculator), where X is the day number and ProjectName describes the project.

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be beginner-friendly.

- Examples cover core concepts like layouts, animations, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

- Perfect for devs, students, or hobbyists starting their front-end journey.

`📄 Project Structure`
- index.html: The main HTML file for the project’s structure.

- style.css: Styling for visuals, layouts, and responsiveness.

- script.js: JavaScript for interactivity (where applicable).

- README.md: Explains the project’s purpose, features, and learning outcomes.

## ⚙️ How to Run<br>
- No setup, no installations—just a browser! 🌐

`Clone the Repository:`
